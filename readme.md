I figured out how to use youtube iframe api to load videos.

It took me a couple of days of trying, testing and asking on stackoverflow.

In the end, I created the function fits my ideas, no compromise.

Next project, I am gonna try fetch api to get github users or stackoverflow users to set up some sort of dashboard UI.
